## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.: To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma.	
- What is the background of your project? : Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. Problem statement it to build model using CNN to try and detect Melanoma.
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve? : A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
- What is the dataset that is being used? : The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC).

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- CNN can be used to evaluate images and the model built using CNN can be then used to predict the outcome.
- Techniques like dropout, Data Augmentation, Class imbalance, Hyper parameter tuning etc help improve the model performance.
